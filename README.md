### 🧭 Project Overview

The main focus of this internship project was to set up a **complete development environment for a simple library management system**, combining multiple technologies into a unified workflow.

**Project 1** was developed during the **first six weeks of the internship**, as documented in the corresponding folders of this repository. During this phase, the work was carried out **collaboratively with fellow students**, focusing on:

- ⚙️ Setting up the local development environment
- 🔗 Exploring and integrating multiple technologies
- 🧩 Designing the core workflow of a web-based data entry system
- 🗄️ Laying the foundation for database-backed forms and data management

The technical scope of this phase included:

- 🐍 Creating basic web servers using **Python (Flask)** and **PHP**
- ⚡ Running PHP through **Apache** for a stable local setup
- 💾 Setting up and managing a **MySQL database**
- 🧱 Working with **Django** and **PostgreSQL** for future system expansion
- 📊 Using **Excel** to organize uncatalogued library book data
- 📡 Learning to operate the **RFID system** for fast identification and tracking of library materials

Together, these tools form the foundation of a system capable of handling book records, internal data entry, user activity, and dynamic website content, which was further expanded in the following weeks of the internship.

| 🐘 **PostgreSQL**                | Relational database used with Django               | 🐘 |
| 🖥️ **Visual Studio Code**       | Main IDE for code development                      | ✏️ |
| 🔌 **VS Code Extensions**        | Python & PHP tools for development                 | 🔌 |
| 🐳 **Command Prompt / Terminal** | Running servers & package installations            | 💬 |
| 📊 **Excel**                     | Recording uncatalogued book data                   | 📑 |
| 📡 **RFID System**               | Identifying books via tag-based IDs                | 🔖 |


### ⚙️ Setup Summary (High-Level)

- Python / Flask: Built a lightweight server for testing HTML responses
- PHP & Apache: Served PHP pages both locally and through Apache
- MySQL: Created and managed local databases for book records
- Django & PostgreSQL: Prepared environment for future development
- Excel & CSV: Organized uncatalogued book data for import
- RFID: Used tag identifiers to locate books efficiently

*(Detailed installation steps will be documented in a separate README.)*
